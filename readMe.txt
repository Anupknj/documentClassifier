Heads up

1. This program runs well on Python 3.7.4 or higher
2. Install scipy, time, numpy, pandas, math, datetime and sklearn
3. Run each file seperately for both naive bayes and logistics regression
4. Try running from command prompt.
5. It takes around 5 -6 hours for naive bayes and 2-3 hours for LR depending on set ups
6. If you want change set up (learning rate, penalty rate), then set value for values in main function
